1. Problem Statement
write a procedure (Function) – lexer (), that
returns a token when it is needed. Your lexer() should return a record, one field for the token and another field the actual "value" of the token (lexeme), i.e. the instance of a token. YOU HAVE TO CONSTRUCT A FSM and YOU MUST write the REs for Identifiers, Real and Integer, and also show the NFSM using Thompson.

2. How to use your program
<write detailed steps/Instructions how to execute your program>

3. Design of your program
< write major components of your program. Also, data structures you
are utilizing, particular algorithms you have chosen etc. >


4. Any Limitation
<All features are running according to the assignment but you limit
your program due to resource limitations, such as
Maximum number of lines in the source code, size of the identifier,
integer etc. Say ‘None’ if there is no limitation>


5. Any shortcomings
<Anything you could NOT implement although that is required by the
Assignment. Say ‘None’ if there is no shortcoming>
